## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Google Fonts: Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) - For font


### What I learned

I learned how to use the Date prototype to create a function that can use the information from the current date to run functions to calculate age. I also learned how to grab the value from the input boxes so that they can be used to set up the functions. Setting constraints using if statements were also a big part of the learning process.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hide_arrow_number.asp) - This helped me figure out how to remove arrows from input number.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event) - This helped me figure out how to pull input value to set up rest of functions.
-[Resource 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) - Used to figure out how to pull the current date to use in functions.
